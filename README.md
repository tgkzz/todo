# Todo

Todo is an application that allows you to create and manage tasks you need to perform. It's developed using Django.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)
## Run Locally

Clone the Todo repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tgkzz/todo
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd todo
```

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to access the application.
